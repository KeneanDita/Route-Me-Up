Beyond the whispering pines,  
Under a sky painted in lavender and gold,  
A curious fox trotted silently along a forgotten trail.  
Each step stirred the leaves of a hundred autumns past.  
The forest held its breath, ancient and still.  
A distant stream laughed like a memory not quite lost.  
Shadows danced between branches as the day faded.  
And in that quiet moment, time seemed to pause.
