# Route-Me-Up - Becoming a Machine Learning Engineer

**Route-Me-Up** is my ongoing journey to mastering the skills, frameworks, and systems needed to become a **machine learning engineer** - not just a model builder, but a production-ready practitioner.

This repo captures what Iâ€™m learning across key areas of ML engineering, from model development to deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

While `R2DS` focuses on data science foundations, **Route-Me-Up** is focused on **frameworks, tooling, and production skills**.

My goal: To become fluent in the technologies and patterns used by real-world ML engineers.

---

## Topics I'm Exploring

- âœ… PyTorch & TensorFlow fundamentals
- âœ… Model training pipelines
- âœ… Experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, MLflow)
- âœ… Model evaluation and diagnostics
- âœ… Deployment (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)
- ðŸ”„ Containerization & Docker
- ðŸ”„ ML system design & MLOps

---

## Why This Matters

> Knowing how to train a model is step one. Knowing how to scale, monitor, deploy, and debug it - thatâ€™s what makes you a machine learning **engineer**.
