# NeuralNet

NeuralNet is a foundational project that demonstrates how to build a neural network from scratch without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks. This implementation is aimed at providing a clear, hands-on understanding of the core concepts behind neural networks, such as forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and activation functions.

The project specifically focuses on the task of recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, which is a standard benchmark in the field of image classification. The neural network was trained and evaluated on this dataset and achieved an accuracy of 85.06% on the training data, demonstrating a strong performance for a model built entirely from the ground up.

This project is ideal for learners who want to deepen their understanding of how neural networks function at a low level and how various components interact during the training process.
